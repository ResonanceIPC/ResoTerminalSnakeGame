# Project Title

The Game of Life is a cellular automaton that simulates the behavior of a grid of cells. Each cell can be in one of two states: alive or dead. The game evolves through generations based on a set of rules, creating fascinating patterns and dynamic behaviors. It is a zero-player game, meaning that its evolution is determined solely by the initial configuration, requiring no further input from the player once the simulation starts.
